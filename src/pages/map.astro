        The data contained in the various MMP databases have been gathered using an approach that
        borrows from anthropological and sociological research methods. In particular, our study
        employs the Ethnosurvey approach, which combines the techniques of ethnographic fieldwork
        and representative survey sampling to gather qualitative as well as quantitative data. The
        two kinds of empirical data are compared throughout the study to yield results of greater
        validity than either ethnography or a sample survey could provide alone. This method was
        designed to provide a picture of Mexican-US migration that is historically grounded,
        ethnographically interpretable, quantitatively accurate, and rooted in receiving as well as
        sending areas.

        Each year, during the winter months (when seasonal migrants tend to return home), the MMP
        randomly samples households in communities located throughout Mexico. After gathering
        social, demographic, and economic information on the household and its members, interviewers
        collect basic immigration information on each personâ€™s first and last trip to the United
        States. From household heads and spouses, we compile detailed year-by-year labor history and
        migration information; in addition, for household head migrants, we administer a detailed
        series of questions about their last trip to the U.S., focusing on employment, earnings, and
        use of U.S. social services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following completion of the Mexican surveys, interviewers travel to destination areas in the
        United States to administer identical questionnaires to migrants from the same communities
        sampled in Mexico who have settled north of the border and no longer return home. These
        surveys are combined with those conducted in Mexico to generate a representative binational
        sample.
