        The Mexican Migration Project (MMP) was created in 1982 by an interdisciplinary team of
        researchers to further our understanding of the complex process of Mexican migration to the
        United States. The project is a binational research effort co-directed by Jorge Durand,
        professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Guadalajara (Mexico), and Douglas S.
        Massey, professor of Sociology and Public Affairs, with a joint appointment in the Woodrow
        Wilson School, at Princeton University (US).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its inception, the MMP's main focus has been to gather social as well as economic
        information on Mexican-US migration. The data collected has been compiled in a comprehensive
        database that is available to the public free of charge for research and educational
        purposes through this web-site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MMP is a unique source of data that enables researchers to track patterns and processes
        of contemporary Mexican immigration to the United States. The project is a
        multi-disciplinary research effort that generates public use data on the characteristics and
        behavior of Mexican migrants.
