      <h2 class="mb-8">Selecting Communities</h2>
      <p>
        The process of selecting communities for the Mexican Migration has traditionally relied on
        anthropological methods. Communities are chosen after a personal reconnaissance of the
        geographic area to be studied by the principal investigators. Because the project initially
        focused on Western Mexico, the traditional heartland for migration to the United States,
        practically all of the earliest communities had significant indices of out-migration, which
        could easily be detected using field interviews and simple observations of the frequency of
        new homes, foreign license plates, currency exchanges, and international courier services.

          Until 2000, we lacked access to a valid measure to indicate the intensity of emigration
          from specific municipalities and the only measure indicating migration was the sex ratio.
          The only demographic fact regularly considered was the community's sex ratio, which offer
          general picture of the intensity of the process of international migration because in
          Mexico emigration is so heavily male. After an initial round of fieldwork, investigators
          compared their preliminary data with census statistics and formation available from
          bibliographic sources. However, the MMP has never explicitly sought to survey only
          communities with high rates of out-migration. Investigators simply seek to corroborate
          that there is some migration from the community in question before proceeding. Then they
          select four specific locations to represent each of four levels of urbanization:

        In the pueblos and ranchos, investigators conduct a complete census of dwellings and
        undertake random selection from the resulting list. In mid-sized cities and urban
        metropolises, investigators generally chose a traditional, well-established neighborhood–one
        not dominated by recent rural-urban migrants. As a result, the urban samples are in reality
        samples of urban neighborhoods or specifically demarcated quarters. In all cases, the
        neighborhood must have at least 1,200 enumerated dwellings, from which a random sample of
        200 is taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        The methodology of the MMP thus yields results with a high degree of representativeness at
        the community level, and in some of the smaller pueblos and ranchos investigators have been
        able to survey every household in the community. Given that the sample is not targeted to
        migrants per se, but surveys the community as a whole, the project needs a fairly large
        sample size to generate a significant number of migrants. Traditional methods of cluster
        sampling generally survey small numbers of respondents across a large number of areas, but
        this generally yields small numbers of migrants to study an inability to make
        generalizations at the community level. For example, rather than interviewing 20 households
        in five communities we interview 100 households in one community, thereby enabling us to
        make generalizations about migratory processes at the community level. If the frequency of
        migration is 30%, on average the surveys would contain only six migrants in each of the five
        communities, rather than 30 migrants in one community.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present we are able to draw upon an index of migratory developed for municipalities in
        Mexico’s National Population Council (CONAPO) based on the 2000 and 2010 census. This index
        provides reliable information about the level of U.S. migration prevailing at the municipal
        level and is particularly useful in identifying new communities of origin for migrants in
        new sending states, where heretofore little information has been available. In sum, after 25
        years of field experience, the MMP continues to use anthropological criteria for selecting
        communities, which are then corroborated with available data from the census and other
        sources to confirm the existence of migrants before making the final selection.

      <h2 class="mb-8">Ethnosurvey</h2>
      <p>
        The Ethnosurvey is eclectic and draws on methods and approaches well-known in sociology,
        anthropology, psychology, and education. Its contribution and complexity lies in the way all
        these methods are combined within a single study. The main idea for the Ethnosurvey is “to
        complement qualitative and quantitative procedures, so one's weakenesses become the other's
        strength, yielding a body of data with greater reliability and more internal validity than
        is possible to achieve using either method alone.” (Massey 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ethnosurvey contains a series of tables that are organized around a particular topic,
        giving coherence to the “conversation”. It follows a semi structured format to generate an
        interview schedule that is flexible, unobtrusive and non-threatening. It requires that
        identical information be obtained for each person, but questions, wording and ordering are
        not fixed. The precise phrasing and timing of each query is left to the judgment of the
        interviewer, depending on circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the Ethnosurvey is explicitly designed to provide quantitative data for
        multi-level analysis by compiling data at the individual, household, and community levels.
        Detailed community-level data are compiled at the time of the survey by the fieldwork
        supervisor; these data are of great help to interpret the socioeconomic context within which
        individuals and households interact (Massey 1987). This small questionnaire is referred to
        as the Community Data Inventory.

      <h2 class="mb-8">Interview Process</h2>
      <p>
        The questionnaires are applied in three phases. In the first phase, basic social and
        demographic data are collected from all members of the household. The interview begins by
        identifying the household head and systematically enumerating the spouse and children,
        beginning with the oldest. All children of the head are listed on the questionnaire whether
        or not they live at home, but if a son or daughter is a member of another household, this
        fact is recorded. A child is considered to be living in a separate household if he or she is
        married, maintains a separate house or kitchen, and organizes expenses separately. After
        listing the head, spouse, and children, other household members are identified and their
        relationship to the head clarified.

          </div>
          <p>
            A particularly important task in the first phase of the questionnaire is the
            identification of people with prior migrant experience in either the United States or
            Mexico. For those individuals with migrant experience the interviewer records the total
            number of U.S. trips, as well as information about the first and most recent U.S. trips,
            including the year, duration, destination, U.S. occupation, legal status, and hourly
            wage. This exercise is then repeated for first and most recent migrations within Mexico.

          </div>
          <p>
            The second phase of the ethnosurvey questionnaire compiles a year-by-year life history
            for all household heads, including a childbearing history, a property history, a housing
            history, a business history, and a labor history. The goal of this phase is to capture
            occupational mobility, health status, migration history, and family formation.

            The third and final phase of the questionnaire gathers information about the household
            head's experiences on his or her most recent trip to the United States, including the
            mode of border-crossing, the kind and number of accompanying relatives, the kind and
            number of relatives already present in the United States, the number of social ties that
            had been formed with U.S. citizens, English language ability, job characteristics, and
            use of U.S. social services.

        <h3 class="font-semibold mb-6">Data Coding and File Construction</h3>
        <p>
          After the ethnosurvey questionnaires are completed and revised, data are entered in
          Mexico. The entry programs perform initial screening, range checks, and simple tests for
          logical consistency. The preliminary files are then transferred to Princeton University,
          where additional data cleaning is performed, numeric codes are assigned to occupations and
          places, and the final data sets are assembled into six primary data files, each providing
          a unique perspective of Mexican migrants, their families, and their experiences. SIX
          primary files have been created, each corresponding to a different unit of analysis: PERS,
          MIG, MIGOTHER, HOUSE, LIFE and SPOUSE. Data at the community level have been compiled in
          the file: COMMUN.

        <h3 class="font-semibold mb-6">Weights</h3>
        <p>
          The MMP database provides community- and sample-specific weights. For each community, you
          will see a single weight for all the households in the home country sample and another
          weight for all the households in the US sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          When working with pooled data from multiple communities, these weights give you the option
          to adjust your estimates in order to take into account the relative sizes of all the
          sampling frames. Whether you will need to weight your estimates or not will depend on what
          your goal is.
